# App Builder Payments Modules

This repo contains project details and a space to begin building the App Builder payment modules required for Stripe and Adyen.

## Github Codespaces, .devcontainer and vscode

This project has a .devcontainer directory which contains a composition capable of running `aio` as well as a cors-anywhere proxy that can be used to get around https issues. To get started with VS Code and devcontainers, install the Remote - Containers extension, open your project in VS Code, and select "Reopen in Container" from the Command Palette. For more details, visit [Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers). 

This project is also hosted in Github, where a Codespace can be used to potentially run this project. This environment is provided as-is, and developers to this project are free to leverage their own stacks.
